# UrbanBowl

To feed today's global population, we need a farm land equal to the size of South America. Despite the excessive amount of land already allocated for agriculture, an estimated 815 million people worldwide still sleep hungry each night. In addition, by the end of 2050 the worldwide population is estimated to be 9 billion. Modern cities of the world already have half the world's population, which follows that the effect of projected growth in the global population will be drastically reduced by the habitable land to maintain modern infrastructure to extreme levels. Urban areas are not built for agriculture but a rapidly changing world already lacking land with hunger and agricultural difficulties inspired us to come up with a solution that can redefine the way we think about agriculture.

Urban-Bowl is a decentralized urban farming platform where individuals could lease empty spaces like backyards or basements to produce food using urban farming methods. Our platform incentivizes urban population into farming by providing them a decentralized market place to sell their fresh produce directly to consumers in their neighborhoods. We are focusing on impact track and our product meets the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:

Goal 2: End Hunger  
Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities  
Goal 15: Reduction in forest loss and land degradation  
Goal 13: Climate Action  
Goal 12: Sustainable production pattern

# Challenges we ran into:

In the beginning of the hackathon, we wrote down tons of ideas on a Google Document. However, the idealization phase took too much time to find the right problem to work on. We thought about every single SDGs and finally pick a problem that connects with a large user group and has a large scope of improvement. Our project is a web3 application built with Vue.js (2.6). Building the architecture was an actual challenge. The payments are done with the help of Metamask which has been implemented with the help of Dapphero. We have integration of Fortmatic for user authentication and also we faced some challenges in enabling decentralized data sharing using IPFS.

# Implementation instructions

Getting started
Before contributing please read the following:

RealWorld guidelines for implementing a new framework.
RealWorld frontend instructions.
Realworld API endpoints.
Vue.js styleguide. 
Priority A and B categories must be respected.
Editorconfig setup. 
Most of the common editors support editorconfig by default (check the editorconfig download link for your ide), but editorconfig npm package have to installed globally for it to work.

# install editorconfig globally
> npm install -g editorconfig

# install dependencies
> yarn install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve


# build for production with minification
>yarn run build

# run unit tests
>yarn test
